# domain-redirector

A Clojure application designed to manage domain redirection using data from a JSON document stored in MongoDB and cached in REDIS.

### Response: HTTP 301

The library maps the original domain, transforms as appropriate and returns the new URL via HTTP 301.

The meaning of HTTP 301 is Moved Permanently. The semantics of this must fit your needs if you wish to use this library.

The detailed semantics of HTTP 301 is explained in [more detail on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_301)

Specifically, 301 is recommended by Google to change the URL of a page as it is shown in search engine results.

Usually a browser will follow redirects automatically and many proxies will do likewise by default or through simple configuration.

## What redirections are supported?

```
foo.com/ -> bar.com/
```

```
foo.com/google -> www.google.com
```

See the examples section to see how to make this work

## Networking pre-requisites

Assuming that foo.com is not this domain, the DNS CNAME for foo.com must point to the domain of this app. Depending on where 
and how you host the app, using DNS A records is possible but more fragile.

## Usage

A JSON document is used to define the transformations that are required. The document requires two objects: source and target.

The table lists the supported properties for *source*:

| Property      | Type     | Values          | Required?  | Default Value |
| --------      | -------- | --------------- | --------   | ------------- |
| domain        | []string | domain name(s)  | *Yes*      | None          |
| path          | string   | resource path   | No         | None          |

The table lists the supported properties for *target*:

| Property      | Type    | Values          | Required?  | Default Value   |
| --------      | ------- | --------------- | --------   | --------------- |
| scheme        | string  | http or https   | No         | Incoming scheme |
| domain        | string  | domain name     | *Yes*      | None            |
| path          | string  | resource path   | *Yes*      | None            |

## Performance

Benchmarks TBD...

Optionally a maximum response time limit can be imposed, after which the app will return a HTTP status 500.

## Limitations

In the existing design, no attempt is made to validate the transformed URLs for dead links.

## Notes for PAAS platforms

### Heroku

The source domain must be added to the list of domains supported by the application. 

This feature is *NOT* provided by this application.

## Dependencies

You need to install locally or have network services that provide MongoDB and REDIS.

The application will attach to these services using the following variables / defaults
 
| Name          | Default Value |
| --------      | ------------- |
| MONGO_URL     | mongodb://localhost/test |
| REDIS_URL     | 127.0.0.1:6379 |

## Options

You can tweak the application behaviour with a small number of options

| Name              | Meaning          | Default Value |
| ----------------- | -------          | ------------- |
| PORT              | Port # for exposed HTTP endpoint | 5000 |
| MONGO_COLLECTION  | Document collection name | domainRedirections |
| REDIS_TTL_SECONDS | # Seconds REDIS caches values | 0 (forever) |
| SLA_MILLISECONDS  | # Milliseconds before SLA fails (HTTP 500 response) | none |

## Examples

###### Example 1: Domain redirection

```JavaScript
{
    "source" : {
        "domain" : [ "localhost" ]
    },
    "target" : {
        "domain" : "www.google.com"
    }
}
```
```
$ curl -I http://localhost:5000/google
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:56:17 GMT
Location: http://www.google.com/
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(7.6.13.v20130916)
```

###### Example 2: Domain redirection from domain/path to new domain with https

```JavaScript
{
    "source" : {
        "domain" : [ "localhost" ],
        "path" : "/google"
    },
    "target" : {
        "scheme" : "https",
        "domain" : "www.google.com"
    }
}
```

```
$ curl -I http://localhost:5000/google
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:56:17 GMT
Location: https://www.google.com/
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(7.6.13.v20130916)
```

###### Example 3: Domain + path redirection (also with multiple source domains)

```JavaScript
{
    "source" : {
        "domain" : [ "localhost" ],
        "path" : "/prius"
    },
    "target" : {
        "domain" : "www.toyota-europe.com",
        "path" : "/new-cars/prius"
    }
}
```

```
$ curl -I http://localhost:5000/prius
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Mon, 16 Mar 2015 15:55:13 GMT
Location: http://www.toyota-europe.com/new-cars/prius
Content-Length: 0
Server: Jetty(7.6.13.v20130916)
```

## Testing

The application comes with a number of pre-built tests to ensure that the general logic is valid.

To confirm, you can run inspect the tests and run them with 'lein test'

Please extend the test suite with your specific needs.

## Pull requests

I will accept pull requests for the core logic and especially for any new tests.

## FAQ

### Do you support query parameter forwarding

Yes. Any query parameters are passed along unaltered. Specifically, no attempt is made to decode or encode query parameters.

### Do you support path transformations (for example with regexes?)

Not yet. Let me know if you need it and the use case.

### Is it possible to use this application as a reverse proxy?

No. That's another use case.

### TODO List

- Memoise the results from REDIS
- Support checking of forwarded links (core.async)
- Support powerful regular expression style logic for route matching (core.match / core.logic)
